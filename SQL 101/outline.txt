SQL 101 - your first query
Database
	a continer for one or more tables
Table
	Like Excel sheet - rows & columns
	each row independent
	Tables have relationships between them
	Use this relationships in queries to connect data
SQL
	Standardized language
	Every vendor has its own dialect but in general moving between isn't onerous
		Oracle, Microsoft, Sybase, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
	English-like - queries are generally readable even w/o a deep understanding of the language
Different from other programming languages
	Declarative vs. imperative
	Declarative:
		Tell the engine *what* you want
		Engine figures out the *how*
	Imperative:
		You dictate the how *and* what
	Same language describes:
		Manipulating data
		Storing data
		Controlling system
	Operate on sets
		Not loops
Basic query parts
	select
	from
	where
	order by
Looks easy?
	It can be
	Also easy to get invalid results
	Easy to write an expensive query
Reason: How SQL Server actually processes the query
	from (pick your tables)
	where (rules for picking rows)
	select (the fields you need)
	order by
		never guaranteed without this!
Selectivity
	The more you can tell SQL Server about what you're trying to get, the better decisions it can make
	Know your indexes
		Like the index in the back of a book
			Not every word is indexed
		Words are columns, rows are pages
		Example: query for one property vs. query all and then filter in Excel
			It sounds like more work but it can actualy be less
Joins
	Cross product
	index/where
