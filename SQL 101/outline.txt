SQL 101 - your first query
SQL
	Standardized language
	Every vendor has its own dialect but in general moving between isn't onerous
		Oracle, Microsoft, Sybase, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
	English-like - queries are generally readable even w/o a deep understanding of the language
Different from other programming languages
	Declarative vs. imperative
	Imperative/procedural:
		You dictate the how *and* what
			Get a stock pot out of the cabinet
			Fill with 4 quarts of water
			For each of these veggies (carrots, celery, onion)
				Go to fridge
				Get the veggie
				Bring to the counter
				Chop
				Put in the stock pot
	Declarative:
		Tell the engine *what* you want
		Engine figures out the *how* to get there
			Put chopped carrots, celery and onion into a stock pot with 4 quarts of water. You'll find all three in the fridge, and the pot is in the cabinet by the sink.
	Same language describes:
		Creating/managing the database as a whole
		Describing the data (schema)
		Manipulating data
		Storing data
		Controlling/programming system
	Operate on sets
		Not loops
		"I need to do this thing to this bunch of stuff" vs. "For each of the things I see, I need to do this thing to it"
Database
	a continer for one or more tables
Table
	Like Excel sheet - rows & columns
	each row independent
	Tables have relationships between them
	Use this relationships in queries to connect data
Exploring tables and relationships
	sp_help - your best friend getting started
	foreign keys
Basic query parts
	select
	from
	where
	order by
Looks easy?
	It can be
	Also easy to get invalid results
	Easy to write an expensive query
Reason: How SQL Server actually processes the query
	from (pick your tables)
	where (rules for picking rows)
	select (the fields you need)
	order by
		never guaranteed without this!
Selectivity
	The more you can tell SQL Server about what you're trying to get, the better decisions it can make
	Know your indexes
		Like the index in the back of a book
			Not every word is indexed
		Words are columns, rows are pages
		Example: query for one property vs. query all and then filter in Excel
			It sounds like more work but it can actualy be less
Joins
	Cross product
	index/where
